<p>This is the documentation for the MirrorLink Android Common API</p>

<h1>Basic usage</h1>

<p>This section summarizes typical usage of the API.</p>

<p>The API is defined using AIDL files. For reference on using them please see the Android
documentation.</p>

<p>The mechanism for connecting to the MirrorLink service is defined in the {@link
com.mirrorlink.android.commonapi.Defs} class. The application can obtain a connection to the server by
sending the {@link com.mirrorlink.android.commonapi.Defs.Intents#BIND_MIRRORLINK_API} Intent. As a
result it will obtain a handle to an {@link com.mirrorlink.android.commonapi.ICommonAPIService}
object. From this object handles to all the available MirrorLink services can be retrieved.</p>
